    The reporter sometimes wraps a bare ``![alt](path)`` in a

    renders as literal text instead of an image. Fence detection follows
    CommonMark's closing rule (same character, closer run length >= the
    opener's) rather than a fixed-length regex, so a legitimate 4-backtick
    (or tilde) fence is scanned correctly instead of mis-parsed.

    Unwrapping is gated on the report's OWN citation discipline, not just the
    fence's content shape: every image inside a candidate block must also
    match a ``[N] Title. PATH`` line elsewhere in the SAME report (via
    :func:`_refs_match`). ``get_report_prompt`` already requires any embedded
    image to be a cited source, so this is a self-consistency check, not a
    guess — and it is what stops a block from being unwrapped when it is
    actually a deliberate demonstration (e.g. the user asked "how do I write
    markdown image syntax" and the model answered with an example — that
    example has no reason to also appear in the References list, so it stays
    fenced). A block with no matching citation, or a report with no
    References section at all, is left untouched — the safe direction; this
    can only fail to unwrap a real image, never wrongly render a fake one. An
    unclosed trailing fence is left untouched too, for the same reason.
