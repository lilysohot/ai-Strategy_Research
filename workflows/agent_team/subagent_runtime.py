    Why: ``NoOpCompactor``'s "no compaction needed" assumption breaks for
    thinking models *and* tool-heavy ReAct loops:

      1. Some reasoning models return large reasoning blocks that the next
         request re-sends
         (``thinking_in_history=true`` + provider-specific
         ``reasoning_content`` round-trip).
      2. Tool messages can also be large enough to exhaust the context window.

    Stripping ``<think>`` alone may not help when tool messages dominate.

    What: keeps the message *structure* intact (every ``ToolMessage``
    keeps its ``tool_call_id`` so the matching AI ``tool_calls`` doesn't
    orphan — Azure rejects orphans with HTTP 400) and replaces the bulky
    parts of messages older than ``keep_recent``:

      * AI ``<think>…</think>`` blocks in ``content`` (tag-mode)
      * AI ``reasoning_content`` field (DeepSeek/GPT-5)
      * Tool ``content`` → one-line stub
        ``[aged-tool: <name> url=<first_url>] <preview>…`` so the LLM
        still knows what was fetched and can re-fetch the URL if needed.

    Recent ``keep_recent`` messages are untouched. Aging is idempotent:
    a tool stub is detected by its sentinel and left alone, so triggering
    every turn after ``compact_after_turns`` is cheap.

    Fires inside the agent loop right after a tool returns and before the

    Replaces ``DefaultToolResultPostProcessor``'s blunt char cap with
    per-tool dispatch: content-retrieval tools (web_fetch, web_search,
    scholar_search) pass through unmodified — academic-paper results
    sections and long Wikipedia articles need their full body. Compute
    tools (bash, run_python_code) keep tight head/tail caps because
    their output is unbounded by design (``find /``, runaway ``print``).

    Web results pass through because relevant evidence may occur after an
    abstract or introduction. Cap upstream at ``TOOL_RESULT_MAX_CHARS``, let
    ``ReasoningStripCompactor`` age old bodies to URL stubs at 200K,
    and trust the Summary LLM (``info_to_extract`` on web_fetch) for
    in-call compression when the agent asks for it.

    Errors (``is_error=True``) bypass all caps — the model needs the
    full error text to recover. ``delegate_subtask`` and
    ``submit_report`` pass through unmodified: sub-agent reports are
    structured and expensive to regenerate, and the terminal-tool ack
    is just a stub.

    Adding a new compute-style tool: append one ``_BUDGETS`` entry and
    a dispatch in ``process`` if it needs custom reshape (like
    ``bash``'s stderr-aware split); otherwise everything falls through
    to ``_head_cap`` with the looked-up budget.

    The hard 150K ``TOOL_RESULT_MAX_CHARS`` cap inside ``execute_tools``
    runs first, so this processor sees at most 150K of input. Output is
