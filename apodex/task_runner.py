        ``BenchmarkSession`` is the project's small, scoped runtime bootstrap:
        it registers the AgentBus, workflow roles, and the full tool registry,
        then restores the caller's registry after the task.  This is important
        for Agent Team: merely placing its tools in the generic terminal loop
        would make it *look* like a team while never creating sub-agents.

        Steering works here exactly as it does in the generic loop: the
        workflow's main agent appends ``sdk_extra_observers`` to its own
        ``run_agent_loop`` observers, so our ``TerminalObserver`` sees
        ``on_turn_end`` and can inject queued lines as the coordinator's next
        user message. Sub-agents already dispatched are NOT interrupted — a
        steer reaches them only through the coordinator's next delegation.
