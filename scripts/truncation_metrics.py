"""Per-arm metrics for a live truncation A/B, read off benchmark run artifacts.

Consumes what a ``benchmarks.runner.run_subprocess`` run already writes —
``trials/<qid>/result.json`` for the score and
``trials/<qid>/agent/trajectories/*.jsonl`` for the turn-by-turn record — and
reports the numbers that separate the two preview shapes:

* ``recovery_reads``  — tool calls that go back for content a truncation cut:
  either one whose arguments name the spill store, or a ``recover_result`` call.
  This is the cost the head-only shape pays: an extra round-trip to fetch the tail
  it cut. It should FALL in the ``middle`` arm.
* ``handle_reads``    — the ``recover_result`` subset of the above, reported on its
  own line. The two mechanisms answer different questions — "did the agent read a
  spill file" and "did the agent use the trajectory handle" — and the merged total
  cannot support either claim by itself.

  Matching both ``.spill`` and ``/spill`` is not redundant. Item 5 moved the store
  out of the workspace, so pre-item-5 runs name ``…/.spill/<hash>.md`` and later
  ones name ``/spill/<hash>.md``. Matching only the dotted form — as this did —
  reads **zero** for every run after item 5, which silently turns "the agent never
  needed to recover" and "the metric stopped working" into the same number.
* ``truncations``     — tool results that came back cut. Should be ~equal across
  arms; if it is not, the arms did not see comparable work.

  Counts site-1/2 markers only, and structurally cannot do better: those cuts
  happen before the ``ToolResult`` is built, so the trajectory records an already
  short body. The site-3 post-processor runs AFTER ``notify_tool_result``, so its
  cuts leave no trace in any recorded body — a run where this reads 7 can still
  have had 43 results shortened on the way to the model. To count those, replay
  the recorded bodies through the workflow's own post-processor.
* ``peak_prompt_tokens`` / ``turns`` / ``tool_calls`` — the run's shape.
* ``compactions``     — counted from the ``TieredCompactor selected=`` lines in
  ``agent.log``, which also say WHICH tier won. Falls back to prompt-token drops
  between consecutive LLM calls when no log is present.
* ``redone calls``    — identical tool calls (same name and arguments) issued
  again AFTER a compaction has happened in that run. This is the instrument for a
  compaction-prompt A/B: a summary that drops what was already done is paid for
  by the agent repeating it, and unlike ``score`` it is mechanical and has decent
  power at a few dozen questions.
* ``score``           — from result.json, so a shape that saves tokens by losing
  the answer cannot look like a win.
