#
# The images therefore bake an OVERLAY VENV owned by the tool user
# (``_DEFAULT_TOOL_VENV``): its site-packages is writable, and a ``.pth`` there
# puts the baked venv's site-packages on ``sys.path``. With its ``bin`` first on
# PATH the model gets a ``python3``/``pip`` pair that sees every baked package as
# INSTALLED, so ``pip install matplotlib`` answers "already satisfied" and only
# genuinely-missing packages are fetched — into the overlay, where they import.
#
# The previous approach (``PIP_TARGET`` + ``PYTHONPATH`` into the tool user's
# HOME) kept installs working but re-downloaded what the image already had:
# ``PIP_TARGET`` is ``pip install --target``, which resolves against the target
# directory alone and ignores distributions installed elsewhere on sys.path —
# and that directory is empty in every fresh task container. On an image whose
# venv held both, ``pip install matplotlib python-pptx`` measured 45 downloads /
# 181 MB with 0 "already satisfied", and the fetched copies then SHADOWED the
# baked, self-tested versions via PYTHONPATH. It remains the fallback below for
# images built before the overlay existed — degraded, never fatal, matching how
# the tool-user drop itself rolls out.
#
# What the tool user may write there is the WHOLE overlay, ``bin/`` included:
# pip has to land console scripts, so narrowing it would break the installs this
# exists for. The overlay is therefore container-lifetime state the model can
# shape (replace ``bin/pip``, drop a ``sitecustomize.py``) where the PIP_TARGET

    Drop-in for communicate(): feeds stdin, reads stdout and stderr, waits for
    exit, and raises ``subprocess.TimeoutExpired`` past the deadline so the
    caller's existing handling is unchanged. Structured like CPython's POSIX
    ``Popen._communicate``: one selector over all three raw fds, driven from the
    CALLING thread.

    **Why not a thread per stream.** That was the first implementation and it
    could wedge the caller forever. A pump parked in ``read()`` holds its
    ``BufferedReader`` lock, and the ``close()`` in ``_CurrentCommands.run``'s
    ``finally`` needs that same lock — so cleanup blocked, and ``run()`` neither
    returned nor raised. It needed only a grandchild outside the process group
    (``setsid``, or ``Popen(..., start_new_session=True)`` — a very ordinary way
    for model code to start a background server): ``killpg`` cannot reach it, so
    the pipe never EOFs. Measured on Linux 5.10 / CPython 3.14, **nothing**
    rescues that pump — not ``os.close(fd)``, not ``dup2`` over it, not
    ``pthread_kill``; a blocked ``read(2)`` on a pipe is uninterruptible, and
    ``close()``/``detach()`` from another thread are themselves the deadlock.
    So the fix is not to park: one thread, one selector, every ``close()``
    lock-free by construction.

    Reading both pipes in one selector is also what makes the naive-loop
    objection moot — neither "the child filled the pipe you are not reading" nor
    "the child will not read stdin until it has written output" can arise when
    all three fds are polled together.

    Retention is capped but reads never stop: see ``_CappedSink``. Stopping the
    reads would block the child in ``write()``, which for a child that never
    exits on its own is the very hang this backend's ``killpg`` contract exists
    to prevent.

        (``foo &``) leaves a grandchild holding the stdout/stderr pipe, and
        ``communicate()`` returns only on pipe EOF — not on the shell exiting
        — so it would block forever (even after a ``TimeoutExpired``, since
        CPython then re-drains the pipe with no timeout). ``killpg`` reaps the

        this for free from their PID namespace / container; CurrentSandbox runs
        on the bare host, so it must reap the group itself.

        Edge: a command that finishes 0 but leaves a surviving daemon blocks
        until ``timeout`` and is then reported as a timeout (the daemon holds
        the pipe past the shell's exit). That is a strict improvement over the
        previous unbounded hang, and cross-call daemon persistence is not part
        of the one-shot sandbox-exec contract anyway.

        Edge: a grandchild that LEFT the process group (``setsid``,
        ``Popen(start_new_session=True)``) is out of ``killpg``'s reach. When
        the worker provides a per-exec cgroup (see ``_exec_cgroup``) the
        ``finally`` additionally kills through ``cgroup.kill``, which such a
        grandchild cannot escape; without one (old pod specs, local dev) it
        survives this call as before. Either way we time out, release our fds

# the reverse order renders clean). Noto CJK carries Latin/Kana/Hangul too, so
# leading with it costs no coverage.
#
# Keep the font chains in sync with ``docker/matplotlibrc``, which is the same
# config baked into the agent images (where it is installed system-wide via
# MATPLOTLIBRC and so covers container mode as well). This copy carries extra
